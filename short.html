            <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold lh-1">What Are Short-Term Investments? </h2>
            <p class="lead my-4">Short term investments are designed to provide considerable returns in a fairly short
              span of time which can be a year or even a few months. These plans are more focused to meet the expected
              near future expenses.
              <br>

              Usually, investors who are more inclined towards short-term investments option arenâ€™t really interested in
              waiting for years in order to get their money multiplied many times over. Instead, they look for quick and
              effective results. This is where short term investment plans come to their rescue.
              <br>

              With short term investment plans, one can expect optimum returns to meet their financial objectives, but
              not massive results as in the case of long-term investments options . . Owing to the lower risks
              associated with short term investment plans, they often rank high on the popularity charts of seasoned
              investors.

              <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold lh-1">Working And Requirements Of Short-Term Investments </h2>
              <p class="lead my-4">The companies which have a strong cash flow have short-term investments accounts on
                their balance sheet. This is because; the companies with strong cash position can afford to invest
                surplus cash in bonds, stocks or other investment securities like treasury bills, etc. in order to earn
                higher interest similarly as a savings account. The major objective of short-term investment plans for
                both investors and companies is to have capital protection while generating good returns on investment.
                <br>
                Any investment is called a short-term investment if it fulfills the two basic requirements. Firstly, it
                provides liquidity. Secondly, the investment should be made for a short-term period of 12 months. A bond
                which matures within a specific time frame is also classified as a short-term investment plan. The
                marketable equity securities are considered as a short-term investment and can be easily traded as a
                liquid fund. Short-term investment plans have specified maturity date which is less than one year.

                <h2>1. Recurring deposit</h2>
                <p> A Recurring Deposit, commonly known as RD, is a unique term-deposit that is offered by Indian Banks.
                  It is an investment tool which allows people to make regular deposits and earn decent returns on the
                  investment. Due to the regular deposit factor and an interest component, it often provides flexibility
                  and ease of investments to users/individuals.
                  <br>
                  However, it is essential to know that RDs are different from Fixed Deposits/FDs . RDs are flexible in
                  most aspects. An RD account holder can choose to invest a fixed amount each month while earning decent
                  interest on the amount. RDs are an ideal saving-cum-investment instrument.
                  <br>
                  Most major banks in India offer Recurring Deposit Accounts, with a term that often ranges between 6
                  months to 10 years, also providing individuals with the opportunity to choose a term according to
                  their needs. However, the interest rate, once determined, does not change during the tenure; and on
                  maturity, the individual will be paid a lumpsum amount which includes the regular investments as well
                  as the interest earned.
                  <br>
                  A recurring deposit is a special kind of term deposit offered by banks which help people with regular
                  incomes to deposit a fixed amount every month into their recurring deposit account and earn interest
                  at the rate applicable to fixed deposits.

                <h2>2. Money market account</h2>
                <p>A money market account is an interest-bearing account at a bank or credit unionâ€”not to be confused
                  with a money market mutual fund. Sometimes referred to as money market deposit accounts (MMDA), money
                  market accounts (MMA) have some features not found in other types of accounts. Most money market
                  accounts pay a higher interest rate than regular passbook savings accounts and often include
                  checkwriting and debit card privileges. They also come with restrictions that make them less flexible
                  than a regular checking account. They are important for calculating tangible net worth.
                  <br>
                  Money market accounts are offered at traditional and online banks and at credit unions. They have both
                  advantages and disadvantages compared with other types of accounts. Their advantages include higher
                  interest rates, insurance protection, and check writing and debit card privileges. Banks and credit
                  unions generally require customers to deposit a certain amount of money to open an account and to keep
                  their account balance above a certain level. Many will impose monthly fees if the balance falls below
                  the minimum.
                  <br>
                  Money market deposit accounts also provide federal insurance protection. Money market mutual funds
                  generally do not. Money market accounts at a bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
                  Corporation (FDIC), an independent agency of the federal government.

                <h2>3. Large cap mutual funds</h2>
                <p>
                  Market capitalizations of companies are primarily classified into three types; that of large-cap
                  funds, mid-cap funds and small-cap funds based on their assets and market evaluation. Any mutual fund
                  investing their investible corpus primarily in companies with significant market capitalization falls
                  under the category of large-cap mutual funds.
                  <br>
                  A large-cap company typically has strong corporate practices and has been in the market for a long
                  time, and hence some of the best performing large cap mutual funds, have generated steady returns for
                  its investors.
                  <br>
                  The returns are usually moderate, but steady. A salient feature defining large-cap companies is that
                  they have a market capitalisation of more than Rs. 20,000 Crore. Another aspect of defining a large
                  cap company is that it must be ranked in the top 100 entities in its segment.
                  <br>
                  It is important to note that large-cap companies and subsequently mutual funds lie low on the risk
                  spectrum.
                  <br>
                  All mutual funds have a singular objective of wealth generation through capital investment. The best
                  large-cap mutual funds are exceptionally reliable in this regard considering that they have been
                  investing their corpus in the market of funding and investment for an extended period; thereby having
                  a strong track record of generating profits.
